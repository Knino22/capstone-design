# capstone-design
capstone project for bachelor in biomedical engineering

This project aims to develop a wearable vest designed to alleviate the physical strain and fatigue experienced by medical doctors during extensive surgical procedures that can extend up to 10-15 hours. The vest will be equipped with an array of sensors and employ vibration technology to stimulate the muscles, thereby reducing the discomfort and potential pain associated with prolonged periods of standing and operating. By targeting key muscle groups, the vest's stimulation is intended to prevent the onset of fatigue, allowing surgeons to maintain a higher level of focus and steadiness. The core technology of the vest revolves around a microprocessor, such as the Arduino Micro, which will control the various sensors and manage the intensity and pattern of vibrations to suit individual needs. The ultimate goal of this innovation is to support the well-being of medical professionals, ensuring that the demanding nature of their work does not compromise their health or the quality of care they provide to patients. The project stands as a testament to the intersection of healthcare and technology, where engineering ingenuity meets medical empathy to create solutions that enhance the practice of medicine.
